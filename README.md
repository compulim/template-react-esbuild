# `template-react-esbuild` on GitHub Actions

Set up a new repo with latest version of [`react`](https://reactjs.org/) and [`esbuild`](https://esbuild.github.io/) installed. Also deploy to GitHub Pages on every commit.

## Background

We want to quickly build a very simple React app as a static website using [`esbuild`](https://esbuild.github.io/) and hosted on GitHub Pages:

- [x] Static website
- [x] TypeScript friendly
- [x] `npm run build` for production
- [x] `npm start` for development server
- [x] [GitHub Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces) friendly

It is impossible to build an unopinionated scaffold. We try to keep things down to a minimal so you can choose what you want.

## How to use

To get started, [use this template to create a new repo](https://github.com/compulim/template-react-esbuild/generate).

After you created a new repo, wait awhile and refresh this page for next steps.
